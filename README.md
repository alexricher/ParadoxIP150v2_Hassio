# ParadoxIP150v2_Hassio
Hassio addon based on the ParadoxIP150v2 project by Tertiush

While there is already a Paradox IP150 addon available for Hass.io (Paradox IP150 MQTT Adapter: https://github.com/alfredopironti/Paradox_IP150), this project makes use of the regular Web port (80) implementation which is sometimes unstable. I sadly couldn't get it working successfully or at least stable enough to use it everyday. Looking around for other projects, I found another implementation by Tertiush's that uses the software port (10000) and found to be more stable.

This project aims to take Tertiush's MQTT implementation using the IP150's software port and package it into a Hass.io addon so everyone can benefit, especially those who who were having issues with the previous addon.

Anyone who can chip in this project is more than welcome as I will have very limited time to invest. Thanks to Tertiush for the hard work and all credits goes to him and alfredopironti who did the first Hass.io addon. :)
